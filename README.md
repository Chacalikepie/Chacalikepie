- I specialize in front-end and back-end software development. Some languages I use include: C++, Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and SQL. I also use Django, Android Studio, and React. One of my most important values is the ability to keep an open mind. I apply this in how I solve problems, learn about new technologies and even in my hobbies like traveling. This makes me highly adaptable and flexible in my work. I believe there isn't a problem that can't be solved.
